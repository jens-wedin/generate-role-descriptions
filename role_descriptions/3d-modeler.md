# 3D Modeler

## Description
A 3D Modeler is a specialized artist who focuses on creating the geometry of three-dimensional objects. They translate 2D concept art and designs into detailed and accurate 3D models. These models form the foundation for animations, games, and visual effects, requiring a strong understanding of form, topology, and technical constraints.

## Responsibilities
- Interpret concept art and sketches to create accurate 3D models.
- Create clean and efficient topology for models to ensure proper deformation in animation.
- Sculpt high-resolution details for characters, creatures, and hard-surface models.
- Create optimized, game-ready models with appropriate polygon counts.
- Unwrap UVs and prepare models for texturing.
- Collaborate with texture artists and riggers to ensure models are ready for the next stage of the production pipeline.
- Maintain a consistent level of quality and style across all models.

## Skills
- Expertise in 3D modeling and sculpting software like ZBrush, Maya, 3ds Max, or Blender.
- Strong understanding of polygonal and subdivision surface modeling techniques.
- Proficiency in creating clean and efficient topology.
- Excellent understanding of human and animal anatomy for character modeling.
- Knowledge of hard-surface modeling techniques for creating vehicles, weapons, and props.
- Familiarity with the 3D production pipeline.
- Strong attention to detail and a keen eye for form and silhouette.
