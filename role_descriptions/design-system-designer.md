# Design System Designer

## Description
As a Design System Designer, you will be at the heart of our design operations, responsible for creating the design foundation, patterns, and guidelines that empower our product teams. You’ll work across the entire design system lifecycle, from defining atomic components and maintaining documentation to ensuring code parity and facilitating adoption in our organisation. This role requires a blend of systematic thinking, pixel-perfect craftsmanship, and technical understanding to bridge the gap between design vision and engineering reality.

You'll be a key advocate for the internal user (designers and developers), championing efficiency and ensuring our digital products are consistent, scalable, and accessible. You'll collaborate closely with frontend engineers, product designers, content designers and brand stakeholders to translate requirements into a flexible, robust design system.

## Responsibilities
- Internal user research: Conduct research with product designers and developers to understand their workflows, friction points, and needs to improve the system’s usability and adoption.
- System architecture & tokens: Define and manage the logic of our design system (tokens, variables, and theming) to support multi-brand (white-label) and multi-platform needs.
- Component craft: Design and build robust, high-quality Figma components that are flexible, responsive, and strictly adhere to our accessibility standards.
- Technical alignment: Partner closely with frontend engineers to ensure design-to-code parity, minimizing the gap between what is designed and what is shipped.
- Documentation & education: Write clear, concise usage guidelines and facilitate onboarding or design craft sessions to teach others how to use the system effectively.
- Governance & maintenance: Manage library updates, versioning, and contribution workflows, ensuring the system evolves without breaking legacy products.
- Inclusive & accessible: Bake accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) directly into the core components, ensuring that every product team inherits an inclusive foundation by default.
- Metrics & health: Collaborate, define and follow-up design system usage, detachment rates, and adoption metrics to measure the efficiency and success of the design system.

## Skills
- Systems thinking: The ability to see the connections between atomic elements and complex views, creating solutions that scale across multiple brands and platforms.
- Technical understanding: A deep understanding of frontend development constraints (HTML/CSS, React, iOS/Android) to speak the same language as engineers.
- Design thinker: Proven ability to facilitate contributions and manage feedback loops from multiple product teams.
- Data-driven mindset: Proficiency in using library analytics to inform decisions on what to build, depreciate, or improve.
- Analytical skills: Strong ability to organize information, naming conventions, and taxonomies for better discoverability.
- Technical proficiency: Advanced knowledge of Figma (Auto-layout, Variables, Properties) and familiarity with Storybook or similar documentation tools.
- Experience: X number of years of experience in UI and design system work, with a strong portfolio showcasing specific contributions to maintaining or building a design system.
- Collaboration: Proven ability to work as a service-oriented partner, supporting other crafts rather than just delivering features.
- Communication: Excellent written skills for documentation. The ability to explain why a pattern exists to both designers and developers.
- Problem-solving: A passion for optimization and efficiency—solving the problem once so others don't have to.
- Attention to detail: Obsessive attention to craft, spacing, and logic to ensure the system is bug-free and reliable.
